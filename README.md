# Angular Landing Page Sample Application
This is a sample application for creating a basic landing page using Angular 4++, Angular Material, and Firebase.   

# Purpose
The purpose is to demonstrate the basics of developing an MVP using the [Angular](https://angular.io) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) Tools chains, including [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/).

It is also an example of using github to create and manage a project.   Many of the project management pieces build on the work done in the [Cloaked Hipster Project](https://github.com/toddwseattle/cloaked-hipster).

Those aspects of development are explained in this projects [wiki]()

# 3 Panel Scenario
Developing an MVP starts with defining a storyboard or scenario for the products main set of value.  The 3 panel for this application is [here]().  

In summary it is the following:

## Trigger
A user is made aware of a new application they want to learn more about via a member of the project team, a social media post, or an email.   The user traverses the link which opens the application to learn more.

## What the User Sees
As a prospective user, on Navigating the landing page URL, I see a positioning page that describes the elevator pitch for the offering as well as supporting benefits.  

A prospective user who is interested in the application can click the 'learn more' button to enter their name and an email to receive updates.  On pressing the button and filling in the data, the user receives and email confirmation and thank you that they have been added to the mailing list.

# Payoff
There are payoffs both to the developer and the user who viewed the landing page.  The developer gets the email and name of the user so that they can follow up with additional information or actions.  The user receives acknowledgement that they are on the mailing list, and they are updated by the application developer of news about the deployment of the application.
